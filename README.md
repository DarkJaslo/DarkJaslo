<h2>
  About me
</h2>
My name is Jon, and I'm a third year student of Computer Engineering at UPC, Barcelona, Spain.<br><br>
  
-Interested in C++, games and DIY<br>
-Forced to learn Java<br>
-Would like to make games, at least for fun<br>
<br>
  Expect a lot of experiments, some of which may contain the worst possible code ever written, directly spawned from the Underworld itself. To me, at least, that's a great aspect of programming too &#128523;
